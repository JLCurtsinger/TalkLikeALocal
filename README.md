# Talk Like a Local

**Talk Like a Local** is a web project dedicated to documenting how people *actually* pronounce place names, regional terms, and culturally significant words across the United States. It exists to preserve local linguistic identity, reduce common mispronunciations, and help visitors sound like they belong—whether they are traveling, learning, or just curious.

The project emphasizes accuracy, respect, and scalability, with a particular focus on Indigenous and regional language influence that is often flattened by maps, GPS, and standardized media.

## Purpose

Language is local. Pronunciation carries history, culture, and identity.

Talk Like a Local aims to:
- Teach authentic local pronunciations of towns, cities, landmarks, and phrases
- Highlight regional and state-specific linguistic differences
- Preserve and respectfully present Indigenous and cultural terms
- Provide an easy, searchable reference for learners, travelers, and locals alike

This is not a crowdsourced slang dump or a novelty site. Accuracy and credibility matter.

## Core Features

- **State-based pronunciation listings**  
  Each U.S. state has its own collection of commonly mispronounced place names and local terms.

- **Cultural and Indigenous terms**  
  Dedicated sections for culturally significant language, including Indigenous terms, with sourcing and language family context.

- **Phonetic clarity**  
  Pronunciations are presented in clear, readable phonetic spelling rather than academic IPA, prioritizing usability.

- **Deep linking**  
  Individual terms can be linked directly, making sharing and referencing easy.

- **Scalable architecture**  
  Designed to expand across states, cultures, and future features without rework.

## Project Philosophy

- **Accuracy over assumptions**  
  If a pronunciation or meaning cannot be confidently verified, it is flagged instead of guessed.

- **Respect over entertainment**  
  Cultural and Indigenous terms are handled carefully, with preference given to official or community-backed sources.

- **Minimal, focused UX**  
  The interface stays out of the way. The content is the product.

- **Evergreen value**  
  The project is built to grow gradually and remain useful long-term, not chase trends.

## SEO & Content Strategy

The project supports long-term organic discovery through:
- Search-friendly blog content (e.g. commonly mispronounced places)

- Internal linking between blog posts and term listings
- Question-based and list-based content formats

Content is designed to funnel users toward core pronunciation pages, not exist in isolation.

Users can:
- Suggest new terms or pronunciations

All submissions are reviewed before inclusion to maintain quality and trust.
