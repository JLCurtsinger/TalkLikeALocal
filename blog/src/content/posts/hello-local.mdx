Quechan is the name of a living people, not just a label on a map. It refers to the Quechan Tribe, also known as the Kwatsan or Kwatsaan people, whose ancestral lands are centered along the lower Colorado River in what is now southeastern California and southwestern Arizona.

### 👂 How to Pronounce Quechan

**Community pronunciation:** KWAHT-sahn  
**Common anglicized pronunciation:** KWEE-chan

While "KWEE-chan" is widely used in English, many members of the tribe pronounce the name closer to "KWAHT-sahn" or "KWAHT-tsahn," reflecting its origin in the Quechan language, part of the Yuman language family.

Because pronunciation can vary slightly between speakers and contexts, the most respectful approach is to follow how the tribe identifies and pronounces its own name whenever possible.

### 💡 Why the Name Matters

Names carry history. For Indigenous communities, they also carry identity, continuity, and survival.

Using or learning the correct pronunciation of "Quechan" is not about being perfect. It is about recognizing that the word represents a people who are very much present today, with their own government, language, traditions, and cultural life.

Mispronunciations often come from centuries of anglicization, not from the original language itself. Learning the original or community-preferred pronunciation helps undo some of that erasure, even in small ways.

### 🔗 Quechan and Kwatsan

You may also see the names **Kwatsan** or **Kwatsaan** used by the tribe. These are not alternate spellings invented later, but names rooted in the tribe's own language and self-identification.

The Quechan Tribe officially uses both "Quechan" and "Kwatsan" in different contexts. When in doubt, defer to how the tribe presents itself in official sources.

### 🌐 Official Tribal Information

For accurate, up-to-date information directly from the tribe, refer to the official Quechan Tribe website:

The site provides information on tribal history, government, cultural programs, education, and community services, and reflects how the tribe represents itself today.

### ⚠️ A Note on Respectful Language

Pronouncing Indigenous names correctly is one small part of respect, but it matters. These words are not artifacts of the past. They belong to living communities.

If you are unsure, it is always acceptable to ask, listen, and learn. Making the effort goes a long way.
