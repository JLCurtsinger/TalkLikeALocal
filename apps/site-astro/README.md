# Talk Like a Local — Astro App (Phase 0)

This is a side-by-side Astro app scaffold added in Phase 0.
- Production remains on the existing Vite app; no deploy changes yet.
- Use locally:
  - npm run astro:dev
  - npm run astro:build
  - npm run astro:preview
  - npm run astro:check

Next phases will port routes into Astro and later flip Netlify to build this app.
